Procedures in this document:

  * Starting a new software stack

  * Upgrading EasyBuild in an existing software stack

  * Adding a new node type to the CalcUA infrastructure


## Starting a new software stack

**TODO**


## Upgrading EasyBuild in an existing software stack

Software stacks on the CalcUA infrastructure may have a long life before they are being
superseded with a new one based on newer compilers. Hence it may make sense to upgrade

things and hence should be done with care and proper testing.

**TODO** Outline safe procedures and practices.


## Adding a new node type to the CalcuUA infrastructure

The following files/routines may need changes: **TODO**
